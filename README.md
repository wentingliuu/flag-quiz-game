# Flag Quiz Game
This is my very first SIDE PROJECT that designed & developed by myself!!! ✨✨✨👏👏👏

When I was thinking about the topic for my side project, I found out that there's lots of national flag designed with tricolour. Wow, that would be great, if there's a mini game designed for recognizing all these tricolour flags. Yap, that's how I started my first side project! 👀

🌟 **[Click Here](https://wentingliuu.github.io/flag-quiz-game/)** to have a try!!!

🌟 This project is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) javascript framework and [Sass/SCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)) stylesheet language.

🌟 I also keep notes on **[Medium](https://wentingliuu.medium.com/%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E9%A6%96%E6%AC%A1-side-project-%E5%9C%8B%E6%97%97%E7%8C%9C%E7%8C%9C%E6%A8%82-flag-quiz-game-b0d5b4272394)** (written in Chinese).

## FEATURES & HOW TO PLAY
*  **STYLISH LANDING PAGE**

Yes, I designed a landing page with *simple animation* for this mini game! Just click "START" to play.

*  **PANIT THE FLAG**

Click the colors on color palette, and those *3 blocks* would be filled with the selected color in order. The *PURPLE* border indicates which block you are painting now. After colored the flag, click "SUBMIT" to see whether you have the correct answer or not.

*  **CHOOSE THE BLOCK YOU WANT TO PANIT**

Even though I have set the step 1 to 3 for you, you still could choose the block you want.
When clicking the block, no matter it's filled or not, the block color would be reset. Thus, you could paint the block again.

*  **TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO WHATEVER LEVEL**

There's totally *24 levels* for this mini game. If you don't want to go through each level, just wanna see the FINISHED scene. Click "LEVEL" button on top-right, and you could go to all levels. (And I putted *flag emojis* in LEVEL page, it could be a hint for you!)
