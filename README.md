# Flag Quiz Game
This is my very first SIDE PROJECT that designed & developed by myself!!! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üëèüëèüëè

When I was thinking about the topic for my side project, I found out that there's lots of national flag designed with tricolour. Wow, that would be great, if there's a mini game designed for recognizing all these tricolour flags. Yap, that's how I started my first side project! üëÄ

This project is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) javascript framework and [Sass/SCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)) stylesheet language. **[Click Here!!!](https://wentingliuu.github.io/flag-quiz-game/)** to have a try!!!

üåü I also keep notes on **[Medium](https://wentingliuu.medium.com/%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F%E9%A6%96%E6%AC%A1-side-project-%E5%9C%8B%E6%97%97%E7%8C%9C%E7%8C%9C%E6%A8%82-flag-quiz-game-b0d5b4272394)** (written in Chinese). Feel free to leave messages to me on Medium, if you get more cool ideas for this project.


## FEATURES & HOW TO PLAY
*  **STYLISH LANDING PAGE**
Yes, I designed a landing page with *simple animation* for this mini game! Just click "START" to play.

*  **PANIT THE FLAG**
Click the colors on color palette, and the *3 blocks* would be filled with the selected color. The "PURPLE" border indicates which block you are painting now. After colored the flag, click "SUBMIT" to see whether you have the correct answer or not.

*  **CHOOSE THE BLOCK YOU WANT TO PANIT**
Even though I have designed the step 1 to 3 for you, you still could choose the block you want.
When you click the block, and the block color would be reset (no matter it's filled or not). Thus, you could paint the block again.

*  **TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO WHATEVER LEVEL**
There's totally *24 levels* for this mini game. If you don't want to go through each level, just wanna see the FINISHED scene. Click "LEVEL" button on top-right, and you could go to all levels. (And I putted *flag emojis* in LEVEL page, it could be a hint for you!)
